I'm a computer scientist, interested in AI, neuroscience, and biomedical engineering.

My research has focused on the analysis of electrophysiological and neurophysiological data (ECG/EEG/fMRI) using signal processing and machine learning techniques. My primary interests revolve around cognitive science, psychology, music perception, artificial intelligence, and biomedical engineering.

In my free time I enjoy playing, composing and producing music at home, watching/listening to podcasts, or playing tennis.
