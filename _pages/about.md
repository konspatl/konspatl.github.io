I'm a computer scientist interested in AI, neuroscience, and biomedical engineering.

My research has focused on the analysis of neurophysiological data (EEG/fMRI) using machine learning methodologies. My general interests revolve around cognitive science, psychology, music perception, deep learning and biomedical engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy composing and producing music at home, reading evolutionary biology, and watching/listening to podcasts.
